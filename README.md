# 🌤️ Weather Visualization Project

A Python-based project that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and create meaningful visualizations:
- 📈 Dual-axis line chart showing Temperature vs. Humidity (5-day forecast)
- 📊 Bar chart for current weather stats (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed)
- 💡 Smart activity suggestions based on current weather conditions

---

## 📦 Installation

Make sure Python is installed, then open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install requests pandas matplotlib



## Usage

- Get your OpenWeatherMap API key from https://openweathermap.org/appid
- Paste your key into the script:
- API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
- Run the main script: python weather_project2.py
- Charts will be automatically saved in the folder Weather_Charts/:
- dual_axis_chart.png → Temperature vs. Humidity forecast
- weather_bar_chart.png → Current stats in bar chart form

You'll also see a weather-based activity suggestion printed in the console 🌈


##  Suggestions =
 {
  'Clear': "☀️ Go for a walk or cycle!",
  'Rain': "🌧️ Chai + code = perfect combo!",
  'Clouds': "☁️ Great for reading or learning.",
  'Mist': "🌫️ Chill vibes — journal or meditate.",
  'Snow': "❄️ Bundle up — time for comfort food!",
  'Thunderstorm': "⛈️ Unplug and stay safe indoors!"
}

## Example Output:
   Weather Now in Ulhasnagar: Rain, 25°C
   Suggestion: 🌧️ Chai + code = perfect combo!
